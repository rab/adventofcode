# Advent of Code 2015 #

There's a nice little [Advent of Code] site that has a new pair of problems to solve each new day (i.e., midnight Eastern time) and this repository holds my solutions using [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)

On December 10th, I was up late and solved the problems right away and got onto the [Leaderboard] (which only shows the first 100 and didn't initially display the time of the solution).

While perusing the [Leaderboard], I made note of when the link was to [Github] and the solution was in ruby.

* [rab/adventofcode](https://github.com/rab/adventofcode) (mine, of course!)
* [asross/adventofcode](https://github.com/asross/adventofcode)
* [edanaher/advent-solutions](https://github.com/edanaher/advent-solutions) Interestingly, in `ruby` or `sed`
* [kristjan/adventofcode](https://github.com/kristjan/adventofcode)
* [ahorner/advent-of-code](https://github.com/ahorner/advent-of-code)

I saw solution repositories using at least Haskell, Perl, Python, Nim, C++, C&#x266F;, Go, Rust, Javascript and one repo had a different language for each day (well, at least until they stopped updating the Readme).

When I was recognized on the [Leaderboard]
