# --- Day 7: Some Assembly Required ---
#
# This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates!
# Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help
# assembling the circuit.
#
# Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number
# from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific
# value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple
# destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.
#
# The included instructions booklet describe how to connect the parts together: x AND y -> z means
# to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.
#
# For example:
#
# 123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.
# x AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.
# p LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.
# NOT e -> f means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.
#
# Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason,
# you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C,
# JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.
#
# For example, here is a simple circuit:
#
# 123 -> x
# 456 -> y
# x AND y -> d
# x OR y -> e
# x LSHIFT 2 -> f
# y RSHIFT 2 -> g
# NOT x -> h
# NOT y -> i
# After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:
#
# d: 72
# e: 507
# f: 492
# g: 114
# h: 65412
# i: 65079
# x: 123
# y: 456
#
# In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?
#
# --- Part Two ---
#
# Now, take the signal you got on wire a, override wire b to that signal, and reset the other
# wires (including wire a). What new signal is ultimately provided to wire a?
